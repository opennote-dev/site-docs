# Flashcards and Feynman-2 Videos 
> Written on April 18th, 2025

Today, we're excited to announce Flashcards on Opennote, as well as a long awaited update to Videos.
### Firstly, Flashcards:
- Flashcards can be generated through the new `@Flashcards` tag in your chatbox, and are displayed on the canvas. Feynman-2 works to generate a custom set based on your ask, your learning profile, and exactly what you want to specify for the set.
- Flashcards are fully powered by Feynman-2's capabilities, and support inferring information from web searches, interactive content generation, and more, all to best support your learning experience on Opennote.
- Custom creation of flashcard sets and sharing of flashcard sets is also coming very shortly to the platform.

### Now, for Videos
- Feynman-2's new Videos are now supported by an upgraded model, able to deliver more detailed content with an emphasis on visualization, focusing towards graphs, drawings, and more, all within the video.
- Video agents have also been upgraded with more advanced capabilities, most notably (and visibly), web search is now available to the video pipeline. Your video requests are now able to search for various content to enhance the accuracy of output.
- To deliver a higher level of accessibility to users, we've incorporated transcripts onto the platform, where you can now view the script of the video alongside the script.
- We've noticed the issues with overlap, and are working to fix these in coming releases.

As always, thank you for your feedback into these features, and we hope to continue innovating further for students at this weekly pace. Go try the new features out today on https://opennote.com/, and let us know what you think! ðŸš€

# Feynman-2 Memories 
> Written on April 13th, 2025
- Feynman-2 has been upgraded to be more pedagogically aware of learner profiles, student ability, and is now much more engaged with practice and tracking of your education.
- Bugs about file upload, context awareness over time, and misuse of memories out of launch are also fully fixed.
- With this patch also comes significant updates to the website's performance, including significant page load, SEO, and various other optimizations to enhance your experience.
- We've also added more functionality to highlight interactive content, and the stability of the drawings feature has been improved.
- The ability to reload a generated response from Feynman to get new content with the same query has been added.

More coming soon ðŸš€
