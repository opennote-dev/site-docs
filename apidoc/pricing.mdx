The Opennote Video API is priced on a per-request basis, which is further broken down into the amount of sections that you generate.

Videos are by default, limited to 5 sections and without specification, can vary between 1-5 sections. 
You can also rigidly specify the number of sections you want to generate in the `sections` parameter.
- A good rule of thumb is that the `Default` model will cost you around `~20` cents per section. 

- If you need more than 5 sections, please contact us at [devtools@opennote.me](mailto:devtools@opennote.me) with the subject line "Video API Sections Increase" or via our [Discord](https://opennote.com/discord), and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

## Pricing Table 
| Model | Input Price (per 1M tokens) | Output Price (per 1M tokens)
|-------|----------------------------|----------------------------
| `Default` | $10.51 | $41.156

As is with any LLM/Inference API, this will be billed on a per-request basis based on the number of tokens.
