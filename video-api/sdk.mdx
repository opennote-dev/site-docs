We mantain two very lightweight SDKs for both TypeScript and Python for the Opennote Video API. 
- You can install either one with `pip` or `npm/bun/pnpm/yarn`.

Both SDKs are fully open source and are open to contributions. If you are interested in contributing, have any ideas, or would like us to take a look at a PR, contact [devtools@opennote.me](mailto:devtools@opennote.me)

Here are examples of both routes in both the SDKs, with the options and installation instructions.

## Python

- The PyPi package can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/opennote/), along with the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/opennote-dev/api-sdk-python).
- To install, run `pip install opennote`.

```python
from opennote import OpennoteVideoClient

client = OpennoteVideoClient(api_key=os.getenv("OPENNOTE_API_KEY"))

response = client.video.make(
    sections=5
    model="feynman2" # <-- Not required, but added for future use
    # If using `messages` instead of `script`
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hello, world!"
        }
    ]
    # If using `script` instead of `messages`
    script=["Hello, world!", "This is a test video."]
)


status = client.video.status(video_id=response.video_id)

print(response, status) # These will deliver the same objects as the endpoints, with type safety. 
```


## TypeScript

- The NPM package details can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opennote-ed/video-client), along with the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/opennote-dev/api-sdk-typescript).
- To install, run `npm/bun/pnpm/yarn install @opennote-ed/video-client`.

```typescript
import { OpennoteVideoClient } from "@opennote-ed/video-client";

const client = new OpennoteVideoClient({ apiKey: process.env.OPENNOTE_API_KEY });

const response = await client.video.make({
    sections: 5,
    model: "feynman2",
    // If using `messages` instead of `script`
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello, world!" }],
    // If using `script` instead of `messages`
    script: ["Hello, world!", "This is a test video."]
});

const status = await client.video.status(videoId: response.videoId);

console.log(response, status); // These will deliver the same objects as the endpoints, with type safety. 
```
