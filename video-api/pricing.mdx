The Opennote Video API is priced on a per-request basis, which is further broken down into the amount of sections that you generate.

Videos are by default, limited to 5 sections and without specification, can vary between 1-5 sections.\
You can also rigidly specify the number of sections you want to generate in the `sections` parameter.

- If you need more than 5 sections, please contact us at [devtools@opennote.me](mailto:devtools@opennote.me) with the subject line "Video API Sections Increase", and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

<Warning>
  Pricing information is currently unavailable. We will include this back as we work to publically launch API access.  
</Warning>

As is with any LLM/Inference API, this will be billed on a per-request basis based on the number of tokens.

<Info>
  We're dedicated to reducing these costs as soon as possible as we continue to scale and build our infrastructure. **Please reach out to us if you have any questions or feedback.**
