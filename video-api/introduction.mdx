At Opennote, one of our core features is the ability to create interactive content. Students learn in a variety of ways, and we focus our platform to make it easy to create content that is engaging and interactive.

One of the ways we do this is through the use of video. On the Opennote platform, you can tag `@Video` in the chat to create a video. However, many users also want to create videos programmatically, and that's where the Opennote Video API comes in.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to [create an account on Opennote](https://opennote.com/signup). Once there, you can navigate to your [Profile](https://opennote.com/profile) page and click the "API Keys" tab. 

Within the API Keys page, you can manage your API keys, billing, and view logs from API calls. These are the API keys that you use in your `Bearer` tokens, as seen in the [API Reference](/api-reference).

You will have to load credits before you make your first API request. You can do this by clicking the "**Load Credits**" button in the API Keys page.

## Rate Limits 

The Opennote Video API has three tiers of rate limits, outlined below: 

| Tier | Requests Per Minute | Requests Per Day |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `Developer` | **3** | **50** |
| `Scale` | **10** | **150** |
| `Enterprise` | **Custom** | **Custom** |

If you hit a rate limit, you will recieve a `429` status code. You can view the rate limit status of your API Organization in your API Keys page. **Please note that rate limits are per API Organization, not per API key, so the rate limit applies to all API keys in the organization.**

**We only increase your usage tier on request**. If you believe that your current usage exceeds your current tier, please contact us at [devtools@opennote.me](mailto:devtools@opennote.me) with the subject line "Video API Tier Increase", and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
